# Financial Portfolio Assistant

##  Project Overview

The Financial Portfolio Assistant integrates three core NLP components to make financial information more accessible and interpretable for non-expert investors:

1. **Text-to-SQL** – Converts natural language queries into SQL for querying personal financial databases.  
2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – Provides grounded explanations of financial metrics and concepts.  
3. **Earnings Call Analysis** – Summarizes corporate transcripts and detects linguistic signals such as sentiment, uncertainty, and forward-looking tone.

These modules together enable clearer insights into financial data, improving decision-making and transparency in portfolio analysis.
