165edecbad790770,"Thank you, Matthew, for that question. The answer is yes. It would be a lot easier for cataract and other postsurgical patients to use the Optejet in my opinion than an eye dropper, and we could certainly go back and look at that again. What we would have to do basically is run a pain study, although only one of them pain and inflammation because according to the FDA, the Optejet delivers an opthalmic spray which is a different form than a thalamic solution. So it requires a Phase III study. Why that's a good thing is that it makes it impossible to replace the Optejet with an eye drop. So from a generic point of view, you can't simply take a molecule we put into the Optejet, and replace it with something that's in an eye drop form. So that's a good thing. But on the other hand, it causes us a little bit more time to get something approved. So the strategy was let's get this additional indication for dry eye, which is a much bigger indication for the product. And then we can make the decision to pivot back and redo a pain and inflammation on study to add that on to the Optejet and then ultimately just be on the Optejet platform.",1,aiera
