So right now, that market is pretty stable and [indiscernible] is selling about $14 million or $15 million, maybe not even that high. per year. So to be successful in this market is going to require, in my opinion, a strong promotional effort to basically do a relaunch of this. So if I look at it, if we do it, it's $1 million to do the registration batches, it's $4 million to file the NDA. So that's $5 million, and that's without making the investment try to lift the market. And that's pretty pricy in a market right now that's doing less than $15 million. So there is already one approved product that's waiting on the sidelines, an eye drop to come in. There's another one that's in Phase III. I think in the end, there may be multiple eye drop competitors in the market, but we would be the only Optejet. So if 1 or 2 of them come in and they're able to resurrect this market, we are entirely comfortable with letting someone else do that and coming in with what we perceive as the better product, better for patients and better for the doctors as well and coming in after they do the heavy lifting.

Regarding our prior partnership with Bausch and Lomb, as Michael mentioned earlier, we reacquired the development and commercial rights to MicroPine and have taken over continued execution of the ongoing Phase III CHAPERONE trial. Our agreement with Arctic Vision covers MicroPine, MicroLine and MydCombi and provides us sales royalties in addition to development milestones. MicroPine in particular, is a significant opportunity in China for pediatric myopia. If approved, MicroPine could be a potentially meaningful source of nondilutive funding for our company over the long term. To date, our license agreements have generated approximately $16 million in license fees, and we have the potential to earn additional $25 million in net license and development milestones from Arctic Vision over the next 3 to 4 years. If our products are approved on commercialization, Eyenovia is also eligible to earn significant sales royalties as well. We are continuing to assess potential pipeline expansion opportunities similar to our Formosa agreement and we will continue to leverage the Optejet technology to address unmet needs and additional large ophthalmic indications beginning with dry eye.",1,aiera
