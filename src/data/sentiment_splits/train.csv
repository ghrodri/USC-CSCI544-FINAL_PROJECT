Clobetasol has an advantageous dosing profile of twice a day without titration versus existing treatments, which require dosing up to 4 times a day. This is particularly important as eye surgery patients are often on multiple drugs during recovery. So any advancement which simplifies the treatment regimen would be welcomed by eye doctors and patients alike. And in terms of safety, side effects we're seeing in no more than 2% of patients.

We plan to publish the full results in a peer-reviewed journal later this year. As previously mentioned, we will soon have 10 sales representatives and 2 sales directors in the field to commercialize MydCombi and clobetasol. Half of this team is already trained and in place, working every day to present the benefits of our products and pull the revenue lever. Additionally, we recently announced a co-promotion agreement with NovaBay, a leading developer of anti-infective eye products. Per the terms of that agreement, NovaBay will promote vobetazole to hundreds of eye care professionals that our salespeople are not calling on through its telephone-based sales real. They will also conduct outreach to eye doctors in those geographic areas that our salespeople are not currently covering. Meanwhile, our field sales force will promote their prescription Avanova antimicrobial live and lash solution to our doctors who can include this product in their suite of pre and postsurgical offerings. In addition to the benefit of additional promotion and potential sales for both sides, each party will also get a percentage of the sales that they generate. This is an extremely cost-effective way to boost our commercial sales reach we believe this agreement will be very beneficial to both parties.",2,aiera

f0061dab93b4faf6,"Longer term, we see a potential opportunity to develop a formulation of clobetasol for our Optojet dispenser as a potential treatment for dry eye, a market estimated to be worth over $3.6 billion. To that end, we plan to engage with the FDA in the coming months to discuss a path forward in that indication. While mobetazole is a great product for us, it is only half of our revenue story. MydCombi is the other half. As you know, MydCombi is the first and only FDA-approved fixed combination of 2 pupil dilation drugs, tropicamide and phenylephrine and the first ophthalmic spray using the Optejet platform. When our sales force talks with customers, they highlight how our products can help book ahead the surgery by using MydCombi as their Mitriata-agent presurgery and clobetasol as their steroid post surgery. We have now hired, trained and deployed half of our 10-person field sales force with the remainder set to come on board in the coming weeks. Also, we continue to make excellent progress satisfying state commercial licensing requirements where required, with MydCombi now licensed for sale in 16 states representing more than half of the U.S. targeted population. We have a dozen other license applications in process.",2,aiera
